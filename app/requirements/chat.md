# Project overview
The goal of this project is to develop a simple Android AI chat application that enables users to interact with two distinct AI contacts. Each contact represents an AI model with customizable characteristics defined by the user (e.g., "you are my math teacher" or "you are my best friend"). All data, including chat histories and AI configurations, are stored locally on the device, eliminating the need for external databases or persistent internet connectivity after the initial setup.
