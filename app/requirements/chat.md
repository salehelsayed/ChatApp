# Project overview
The goal of this project is to develop a simple Android AI chat application that enables users to interact with two distinct AI contacts. Each contact represents an AI model with customizable characteristics defined by the user (e.g., "you are my math teacher" or "you are my best friend"). All data, including chat histories and AI configurations, are stored locally on the device, eliminating the need for external databases or persistent internet connectivity after the initial setup.

# Core Functionalities

1- User Interface (UI):
- A clean and intuitive UI showcasing two contacts representing different AI models.
- An input option next to each contact for users to define or modify the AI's characteristics and features.

2- AI Model Customization:
- Enable users to personalize each AI contact by typing in specific roles or characteristics.
- Store these custom attributes locally to maintain consistency across chat sessions.
- Expected outcome:
    - Click the settings icon on either AI contact
    - Enter a custom role (e.g., "Math Teacher" or "Best Friend")
    - Click Save to store the role
    - The role will persist even if you close and reopen the app

3- Chat Interface:
- Real-time messaging system where users can send and receive messages from the AI contacts.
- Display chat histories with each AI contact separately.

- Expected outcome:
    - 1- Real-time Messaging System:
        - Users can type messages in the input field at the bottom
        - Messages appear instantly in the chat
        - Messages are displayed in a scrollable list
        - User and AI messages are visually distinct
    - 2- Chat Interface Features:
        - Shows contact name and role in the toolbar
        - User messages are right-aligned with a blue background
        - AI messages are left-aligned with a gray background
        - Each message shows its timestamp
        - Messages automatically scroll to the latest when sent
        - Input field supports multiple lines
        - Send button to submit messages
    - 3-Visual Improvements:
        - Material Design components throughout
        - Card-based message bubbles with elevation
        - Different colors for user and AI messages
        - Proper spacing and margins
        - Time stamps below each message

4- Local Data Storage:
- Utilize Android's local storage mechanisms (e.g., Room database or SharedPreferences) to save chat histories and AI configurations on the device.
- Ensure data persistence even when the app is closed or the device is restarted.

5-Offline Functionality:
- Design the app to function without the need for internet connectivity after initial setup.
- Incorporate on-device AI processing to generate responses from the AI contacts.

# Technology Stack
To develop the Android AI chat application, the following technology stack is recommended:

Programming Language:

Kotlin: The preferred language for Android development due to its modern features and full support from Google.
Development Environment:

Android Studio: The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.
Android Architecture Components:

Android Jetpack Components: Utilize components like ViewModel, LiveData, and Data Binding for efficient app architecture.
Navigation Component: For handling in-app navigation.
User Interface Design:

Material Design Guidelines: Adhere to Material Design principles for a consistent and intuitive UI.
RecyclerView: For displaying chat messages in a scrollable list.
ConstraintLayout: For flexible and responsive UI layouts.
Local Data Storage:

Room Persistence Library: An abstraction layer over SQLite to handle database operations efficiently.
SharedPreferences: For storing simple key-value pairs like user-defined AI characteristics.
On-device AI Processing:

TensorFlow Lite: For running machine learning models on Android devices.
ChatGPT-4 Model Adaptation: Utilize a mobile-compatible version of the ChatGPT-4 model, optimized for on-device performance.
Dependency Injection:

Hilt (by Dagger): For managing dependencies and promoting modular code.
Coroutines and Flow:

Kotlin Coroutines: For asynchronous programming.
StateFlow/SharedFlow: For reactive programming patterns.
Third-party Libraries:

Gson or Moshi: For JSON parsing if needed.
Glide or Picasso: For image loading if the app includes avatars or media.
Testing Frameworks:

JUnit: For unit testing.
Espresso: For UI testing.
Mockito: For mocking dependencies in tests.
Version Control and Collaboration:

Git: For source code management.
GitHub or GitLab: For repository hosting and collaboration.
AI Model Integration:

ChatGPT-4: Use the capabilities of ChatGPT-4 to power the AI contacts.
Model Optimization Techniques: Apply quantization or pruning to optimize the model for mobile devices.


# Important Implementation Notes
AI Model Integration:

Model Compatibility: Since ChatGPT-4 is resource-intensive, integrate a compressed or distilled version suitable for mobile devices.
On-device Processing: Ensure the AI model runs efficiently on-device to provide quick responses without requiring internet access.
Customization Handling:

Dynamic Prompting: Implement a system where the AI's behavior adjusts based on user-defined characteristics by modifying prompts or context.
Data Security: Store user inputs securely to prevent unauthorized access.
Performance Optimization:

Efficient Memory Usage: Optimize memory management to prevent app crashes due to limited device resources.
Asynchronous Operations: Use coroutines for non-blocking operations, especially during AI processing.
User Experience Enhancements:

Typing Indicators: Show a progress indicator while the AI generates a response.
Editable Characteristics: Allow users to update AI characteristics easily from the chat interface or settings.
Error Handling: Provide informative error messages for any issues during AI response generation.

Privacy Considerations:

Local Data Storage: Emphasize that all data is stored locally and not transmitted externally.
User Consent: Obtain user consent for any data collection or processing that occurs.
Data Encryption: Consider encrypting sensitive data stored on the device.
Scalability and Extensibility:

Modular Architecture: Design the app with a modular architecture to facilitate future feature additions.
Expandable Contacts: Structure the code to easily add more AI contacts if needed.
Resource Management:

Battery Consumption: Optimize the app to minimize battery usage, especially during prolonged AI interactions.
Network Usage: Although the app is designed for offline use, ensure minimal network usage during initial setup or updates.
